Hi, I'm Rui Almeida  
Systems & Security Enthusiast | Clinical & Engineering Background | Remote-Ready (UK/EU)

With experience in civil engineering and nursing, I’m expanding my skills in secure systems, automation, and cloud technologies — aiming to strengthen data integrity and resilience in regulated environments.

🎯 Current Focus  
- Studying system fundamentals, security protocols, and cloud concepts (CompTIA Security+ & CySA+)  
- Building hands-on labs in automation, logging, and incident detection  
- Practicing real-world scenarios on TryHackMe and Hack The Box  
- Learning AWS security, Python scripting, and Linux system tools

📁 In-Progress Projects (coming soon)  
- Python scripts for system scans and automation  
- Cloud logging and IAM integration demos  
- Documented lab writeups with step-by-step analysis  
- Security information and event management (SIEM) setup guides

🧭 Goal  
To apply interdisciplinary skills to help build secure, reliable, and future-ready digital infrastructure in healthcare and other regulated sectors.
